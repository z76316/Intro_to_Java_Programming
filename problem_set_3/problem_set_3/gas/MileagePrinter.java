//Write a program called MilagePrinter that asks the user to input the following values:
//  The number of gallons currently in the tank
//  The fuel efficiency in miles per gallon

//and then prints how far the car can go on the gas in the tank and the cost of driving 100 miles. 
//Print the distance with 1 decimal point and the cost with 2 decimals.

//Use System.out.print and not System.out.println. Otherwise your output will not be
//formatted correctly

//Assume the cost per gallon is $3.95. Define it as a constant:
//     final double COST_PER_GALLON = 3.95;

//If value entered for efficiency is less than or equal to 0, print "No can go".
//Otherwise continue with the calculations. You output should be in the exact
//format shown below. The text will be identical - only the numbers will change.

//Sample runs for the final version:
//Enter the number of gallons of gas in the tank 5.1
//Enter the fuel efficiency 35.0
//Distance:   178.5
//Cost:       11.29

//Enter the number of gallons of gas in the tank 25
//Enter the fuel efficiency -5
//No can go

// "Starting points: Problem Set Questions", go to the
// problem titled "Problem Set 3 - Question 2" for some tips on 
// how to begin. 

//Important: Be sure to print the string exactly as shown
